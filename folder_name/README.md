Finished part 1 of the caster. All of the keyboard shortcuts are cool. - 9/21

Finished the mount. You can make the same part in so many different ways, there isn't really a wrong way to do it. - 9/21

Finished the fork. It was easy to do all to the chambers and fillets. I also used to struggle with the mirror tool, but now I'm getting the hang of it. - 9/21

Finished the tire. It's really quick to do and this only took two features after you sketched it. - 9/22

Finished the wheel. I'm getting used to this. I was never too good at solidworks because I didn't practice much, so I'm hoping I can get good with OnShape. - 9/23

Finished the last few parts. Can't wait to assemble them and see the final product. - 9/23

Finished the wheel and axle assembly. I think sub assemblies is smart and keeps you organized. - 9/23

Finished the whole Caster. Overall I li=ove this program a whole lot more than Solidworks - 9/24
